# NawahToken.sol

This folder contains the official smart contract for Nawah Token (NWTK).  
The contract is upgradeable (using OpenZeppelin) and includes:

- 0.5% transaction fee
- 50% of fees go to a support fund
- Fees accumulate inside the contract and are withdrawable
- Ownership-based management for updating settings

- Important Notice:
Never commit or upload your .env file containing secret keys or sensitive information to GitHub or any public repository.
Always use the .env.example file as a reference to create your local .env file, and fill in the appropriate values that should remain private.

## Deployment Instructions

1. Compile using Solidity ^0.8.17 with OpenZeppelin contracts-upgradeable
2. Deploy via a proxy (UUPS or Transparent)
3. Call `initialize()` (no parameters needed) â€” it will assign msg.sender as the owner, feeCollector, and supportFund.
